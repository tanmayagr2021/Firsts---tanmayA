            <li>Each player controls their car using designated keys.</li>
            <li>Player 1 uses the Arrow keys to move right and left.</li>
            <li>Player 2 uses 'D' to move right and 'A' to move left.</li>
            <li>The objective is to cross the finish line first.</li>
            <li>Players cannot continuously press the keys; they will have to tap them instead.</li>
